# RockPaperScissors
JavaScript practice by creating a rock paper scissors simulator under The Odin Project. A lot of credit goes to CatQueenCodes. Her example of this project was simpler than others and easier to follow. I honestly struggle with the JS portion still and am hoping to continue to work through projects like this to gain a more complete understanding.
